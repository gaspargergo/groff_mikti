Mom is in the contrib directory of the groff git repo, which means
that building groff from sources automatically installs mom and her
documentation.  Official releases of groff include the version of
mom current at the time of the release.

Mom is updated frequently between groff releases.  A tarball
of the current version is always available from mom's website
(https://www.schaffter.ca/mom/mom-01.html).  If you're reading this,
you've obtained your copy of mom from the website and should follow
these simple installation procedures.

If you have superuser priviledges:
---------------------------------

Copy or move the file om.tmac to a legal groff macro (tmac)
directory.  On a Debian (or derivative) box, a good choice is

    /usr/share/groff/site-tmac

although other in GNU/Linux distros, another tmac directory may be
more appropriate.  If you're not sure, do

    locate tmac

to find an appropriate directory.

If you already have a version of mom on your system that came with
groff, you may wish to keep your old version of om.tmac, the main
macro file.  In that case, I suggest renaming your original om.tmac
to om.tmac.orig, and making om.tmac a symlink to the newer version.
Should you wish to revert to the original, remove the symlink and
rename om.tmac.orig back to om.tmac.

If you want mom available to everyone on your system, make sure both
user and group are root, and the file permissions are set to 444
or 644.

Alternatively:
-------------

An easy alternative is simply to put the new version of om.tmac in
your home directory.  Provided that you don't have a
GROFF_TMAC_PATH variable that reads other directories ahead of your
home directory, this alternative should be sufficient.

Otherwise, copy or move the file om.tmac to the directory of your
choice and add

    export GROFF_TMAC_PATH="<full path to directory>"

to your .bashrc or .profile.  If you want mom available immediately, do

    source ~/.bashrc
          or
    source ~/.profile

or log out of your current shell and log back in again.

If you already have a version of mom on your system that came with
groff, you'll have to disable your old version of om.tmac.  The easiest
way is to rename your original om.tmac to om.tmac.orig.  Should you wish
to revert to the original, rename om.tmac.orig back to om.tmac and move
the newer om.tmac off the groff tmac path.

The documentation
-----------------

The html manual (in the directory /momdoc) can go anywhere you like,
although if you want others to read it, make sure it's world readable
and in a directory everyone can access.
